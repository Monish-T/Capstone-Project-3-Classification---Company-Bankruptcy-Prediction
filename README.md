Bankruptcy can have several negative consequences for the business owners, employees, customers, and suppliers.

Given the dataset of financial information of companies, by Taiwan Economic Journal, operating in Taiwan between 1999 and 2009, the goal of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a company will go bankrupt or not based on their financial information. The project aims to help, make better decisions towards short positions for investors, Banks for there Loans by providing early and accurate signs of bankruptcy, which can help businesses take necessary actions to solve financial distress.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the Bankruptcy of companies, using Financial data and other relevant features.

The main steps of the project are:

1. Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).: I have performed basic EDA to understand the data and its characteristics.

 also, have used Univariate - BI variate - and Multivarite analysis to Understanding the correlation between variables and to explore distribution and intercation of variables.

 also have also used visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc. to display the results of EDA.

2. Hypothesis testing. I have performed hypothesis testing to test the relationship between the variables. 

  also have used statistical tests such as t-test, f-test. to compare the means or proportions of different groups or categories.


3. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing. : to create and select the most relevant and informative features for the model. 

  also have used methods such as correlation analysis variance threshold, etc. to select the best Numerical features for the model. For Categorical variable the result of Hypothesis testing is used.

  also have also performed data cleaning, Scaling and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

4. ML Model Development and Evaluation : In this project Have developed and evaluated different machine learning Models. Have used both Distance based algorithm Linear and Polynomial Regression. Also have used Tree Based Algorithm. 

  Used Different techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, regularization, etc. to optimize the model parameters and performance.

  evaluated the model performance using metrics such as Precision,Recall,f1 score and ROC-AUC score and curve.

5. Model Interpretation and Explanation : explained the model predictions using methods such as SHAP values.

  It helped to analyzes the effect of different factors on the Bankruptcy and identifies the key drivers and patterns.
